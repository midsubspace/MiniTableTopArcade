# 🎲 Mini Table Top Arcade
*From simple text Bingo to a living 2D board game world — built in Mini Micro, one table at a time.*

---

## 🧩 Overview
**Mini Table Top Arcade** is a long-term Mini Micro project that begins with a text-based **Bingo** prototype and aims to evolve into a full 2D world of **card and board games**.  
Inspired by *The Coin Game*, this project reimagines that cozy arcade feeling — but instead of coin-op machines, players will explore locations of interactive tabletop games.

---

## 🎯 Current Goal
Start small: build a functional, text-based **Bingo** game.
- One player vs NPCs (eventually)
- automatic marking then manual
- Random caller logic
- Bingo validation and win checking

Once the Bingo core is stable, the foundation can be reused for future games (cards, dice, etc.).
